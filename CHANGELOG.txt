0.6.1
    Minor fixes
    - updated doc.rs configuration to include all features
    - updated README

0.6.0
    New features
    - all core traits and types are now in a separate crate `sophia_api`
    - new trait TTerm, making the whole API more generic
    - functions for checking graph and dataset isomorphism
    - IRI management no has its own crate `sophia_iri`
    Other major changes
    - changed method names for getting datasets from a graph
    Improvements
    - traits CollectibleGraph and CollectibleDataset are more general
    - RDF/XML parser is now faster and less buggy
    Dev
    - some secondary tests are now hidden behind the `all_tests` feature,
      making "everyday testing" faster

0.5.3
    Fixes
    - regression of test_macros

0.5.2
    Fixes
    - fix semantic mismatch in test_dataset_impl macro
    - sophia_jsonld now depends on the correct version of sophia

0.5.1
    Fixes
    - regression of test_macros

0.5.0
    New features
    - new trait CollectibleGraph/CollectibleDataset
    - new method collect_triples/collect_quads on streams
    - Term now has its own crate `sophia_term`
    - preliminary JSON-LD support in crate `sophia_jsonld`
    Other major changes
    - Term API and implementation much improved by @MattesWhite
    - streams (TripleSource, QuadSource) as function arguments are now generally consumed

0.4.0
    New features
    - Turtle, TriG, Generalized TriG parsers
    Improvements
    - N-Triples and N-Quads parsers are much faster, thanks to @Tpt's rio
    Improved API
    - No more lifetime parameter in Triple, Quad, Graph, Dataset
    - Common traits for parsers and serializers
    - More idiomatic API for Triple- and QuadSource
    Dev
    - reduced dependancies (coercible-errors, error-chain, pest)
    - no more central Error type

0.3.0
    New features
    - support for quads and datasets
    - N-Quads parser and serializer
    - RDF/XML parser (thanks to @althonos)
    - preliminary query processor
    Improved API
    - better naming of modules and methods
    Fixed bugs
    - language tags are now case-insensitive (thanks to @althonos)
    - #10 percent-encoded IRIs are now accepted
    Dev
    - CI configuration (thanks to @MarcAntoine-Arnaud)

0.2.1
    Updated dependencies
    Committed CHANGELOG.txt

0.2.0
    Improved API
    - the Graph trait is more generic
    - the TripleSource trait is now basically equivalent to an iterator,
      which is more idiomatic
    - unified and efficient error handling (with coercible_errors)
    - some types and traits were renamed to improve clarity
    Improved test coverage
    Changed license to CECILL-C (less constraining than CECILL-2.1)

0.1.0
    Initial release
